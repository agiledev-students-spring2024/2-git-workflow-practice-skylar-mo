Starlink is a company I have had an interest in for a few years and I always look forward to watching their launches. SpaceX has been launching these internet satellites consistently for the past few years, with a goal to have 10,000 in orbit by 2027. Although I was excited to see the technological advancements that Starlink would bring, I wondered how these satellites would affect the night sky, and if that would have a negative impact on astronomers' research.

This article discusses how images have already been affected by the satellites and how in the future this impact will increase. They then discuss how technology and software are being developed in order prevent these disturbances so that astronomers can continue their research without streaks on their images. I found this to be an exciting new area of software development as I hope to join the aerospace industry as a software engineer in the future. I also find it interesting that as engineering advances, software development also advances alongside it to build a more technologically advanced future, creating an exciting future for students like myself.

- The points brought up by the article are hopeful and concerning to me. I am hopeful for the progress of humanity and I find it cool that Starlink is doing what it is doing and bringing wifi to people in various situations that otherwise wouldn't have it in a feasible way, but it hurts me to know that we are potentially altering the natural atmosphere of the Earth in a sort of permanent way that might even stop us from taking good pictures of stuff in space without interference. I hope that the solutions proposed in the article work out well, as the best of both worlds would have the success of Starlink as well as no adverse side effects anywhere. - Daniel Ni (mitchytic)
